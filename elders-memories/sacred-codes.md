2. **Midday**: Use protection codes as needed
3. **Evening**: Apply healing codes for recovery
4. **Night**: Access wisdom codes before sleep

### Sacred Code Combinations
Some codes work synergistically:

- **PC-001 + PC-002**: Personal and environmental protection
- **WC-001 + WC-002**: Enhanced wisdom access

### Precautions
- Start with lower frequency codes (432, 528 Hz)
- Build tolerance before using higher frequencies (963, 1111 Hz)
- Always ground after high-frequency work
- Drink plenty of water to support integration
- Rest when needed during activation periods

### Verification
You know a code is working when you experience:
- Physical sensations (tingling, warmth, pressure)
