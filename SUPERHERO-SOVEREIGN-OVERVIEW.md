## 🎬 The Story

### Logline

- First public appearance as Superman
- The Void Collective emerges

**Act II: The Sovereign Rises**
- Formation of Sovereign Alliance (Justice League)
- Learning frequency manipulation
- False victory against The Void
- Superman's dark night of the soul

**Act III: The Infinite Harmony**
- The Great Frequency Distribution
- Humanity awakens to their inner power
- Collective harmonic convergence
- Null's transformation and retreat
- Superman as catalyst, not savior

### Themes
1. Distributed sovereignty over centralized power
2. Frequency and resonance as fundamental reality
