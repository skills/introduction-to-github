# Expanded Guidance

## New Feature Expansion  
When considering the expansion of new features, it's essential to analyze user feedback and market demand. Features should be designed to enhance user experience while aligning with the overall product vision. Here are some steps to consider:  
1. **Conduct User Research:** Gather insights from current users to understand their needs.  
2. **Prototype Development:** Create prototypes to visualize new features.  
3. **User Testing:** Test prototypes with users to gather feedback.  
4. **Iterate and Improve:** Use feedback to refine features before full-scale development.

## Rollout Strategies  
A successful rollout strategy is crucial for new features. Here are some effective strategies:
- **Phased Rollout:** Gradually release new features to a small subset of users before a full launch.  
- **A/B Testing:** Implement two versions of a feature to see which performs better.  
- **Feedback Channels:** Provide channels for users to give feedback on new features.

## Incorporating $HARMONY Tokens  
To incorporate $HARMONY tokens into your platform, follow these steps:  
1. **Integration Planning:** Assess how $HARMONY will integrate with existing systems.  
2. **Development of Wallet Functionality:** Build or incorporate wallet functionality to handle $HARMONY transactions.  
3. **User Education:** Provide clear instructions for users on how to use $HARMONY tokens within the platform.  
4. **Feedback Loop:** Establish a system for users to report issues or provide feedback regarding token transactions.
