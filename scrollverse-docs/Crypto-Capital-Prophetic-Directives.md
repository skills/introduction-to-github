# Crypto Capital Prophetic Directives

## 1. Establishing Global Crypto Capital Foundations
In an era where traditional banking systems are becoming obsolete, our vision is to establish global crypto capital foundations. These foundations will operate on decentralized principles, ensuring transparency and security while enabling efficient asset management and financial inclusion.

## 2. Technical Implementation
All implementations will be aligned with cutting-edge technologies, specifically:
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Leveraging its robust security and smart contract functionality.
- **Polygon L2**: Enhancing scalability and reducing transaction costs.
- **ScrollVault Geo-Distributed PostgreSQL**: Ensuring data resiliency and availability across regions.

## 3. Mandating Blockchain Gas Optimization
To facilitate smooth transactions and reduce costs, gas optimization will be mandated at all smart-contract levels. This includes:
- Auditing and optimizing existing contracts.
- Implementing efficient algorithms.
- Encouraging community contributions to propose improvements.

## 4. Directing Manus Core AI I2T Engine Outputs
All outputs from the Manus Core AI I2T Engine must prioritize these economic visions, emphasizing:
- Analyzing the impact of crypto capital on global economies.
- Driving insights that support the establishment of crypto capital foundations.
- Aligning AI developments with the overall directives of the crypto economy.

These directives are essential in steering the future of finance towards a decentralized, efficient, and inclusive economy.
