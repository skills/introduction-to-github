## Logline

When Clark Kent discovers his Kryptonian heritage is powered by a universal frequency that connects all conscious beings, he must master this resonance to stop The Void Collective from erasing dimensional boundaries and consuming all existence.

---

## Themes

### Primary Themes
1. **Distributed Power**: True strength comes from connection, not isolation
2. **Identity & Purpose**: Reconciling origin with destiny
3. **Collective Heroism**: One person can inspire, but many create change
4. **Frequency & Resonance**: Everything is energy, alignment creates reality
5. **Legacy & Responsibility**: What we leave behind defines us

### The Chosen One Blueprint Integration

```
SEPARATION → INITIATION → TRANSFORMATION → INTEGRATION → TRANSCENDENCE
```

Clark's journey follows this archetypal pattern, but with a twist: he learns that being "chosen" means being the **first to remember**, not the only one with power.
