## Step 4: Merge your pull request

_Nicely done! :sunglasses:_

You successfully created a pull request. Now it's time merge it!

**What is a merge?**: A _[merge](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge)_ adds the changes in your pull request and branch into the `main` branch. For more information about merges, see "[Merging a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request)."

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge the pull request

1. Click **Merge pull request**.

   > **Note:** You may see workflows running on your new pull request, causing the merge button to be inactive. Just wait a moment for them to finish and the merge button will activate.

2. Click **Confirm merge**.

   > **Tip:** Did you notice this dialog looks similar to adding a file? A merge is also a kind of commit!

3. Once your branch has been merged, you don't need it anymore. To delete this branch, click **Delete branch**.
